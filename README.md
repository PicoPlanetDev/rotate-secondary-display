# rotate-secondary-display

This is just a quick-and-dirty set of tools for rotating my second monitor into portrait mode for programming and writing long documents.

No packages beyond the standard library are required, however, `display64.exe` must be extracted to this directory. It can be downloaded from here: <http://noeld.com/programs.asp?cat=misc#display>

## Usage

1. Download `display.zip` from the link above, and extract its contents to this folder, making sure that `display64.exe` is directly in this directory.
2. Modify `toggle.py` as needed to customize the display rotations that you would like to toggle between
3. Run `toggle.py` to test your changes (if any were necessary)
4. Create a shortcut to run `toggle.py` and place it somewhere convenient
